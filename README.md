Hello! This is Rubi Preethi... We all at sometime experienced the situation when we really wanted to watch something productive on Youtube but ended up scrolling mindlessly or watching other videos of no relevance.... That's why I thought of building this chrome extension... This will be much useful for those who wish to spend their time productively! Start using your time productively with this extension!! Hope it will be helpful:)
